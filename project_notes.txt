Created all objects per Adam's tutorial on PluralSite.

Only difference: 
	I named my project "TheSolution" rather than "SolutionName", so that I can easily tell when I am in my project.

The Issue
---------------------
Cannot get "Create" page to work, as if it does not fire the action behind the "Save" button.

I tried Adam's excersie files, from folder:
	"3-parent-child-data-ef-m3-exercise-files", "after"
It works.

Attempted Solve
---------------------
Copied all of Adam's code directly into my files for these:
	salesorderviewmodel.js
	SalesController.cs
	Create.cshtml

Then I validated all files against Adam's files, for correct syntax and case in all other significant files.

Result
---------------------
Still not working...
